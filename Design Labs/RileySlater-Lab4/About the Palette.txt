I think all of the colors would be, more or less, applicable here. I didn't
want to use too many colors because I didn't want to oversaturate the page,
and/or I didn't want to have too much distraction from the content. I did
some research by looking at the websites of various tractor companies and
for the most part they all had fairly minimal designs. So, I shot for a
minimal design as well.
